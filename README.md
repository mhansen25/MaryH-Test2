# Description: 

This test is to go over creating a Repository and making it into a project. Within the project, we were tasked to create issues and complete them by making an individual branch for each issues and committing to it. This teaches us how to properly use github with our IDE, I am using eclipse. This assists us for future class projects as well as solo projects to build our career portfolio. 

I do realize I went a little wrong by creating the issues all at once, along with the branches, rather than one at a time as I was completing the test. This resulted in pull discrepencies that I ended up resolving at the end.
